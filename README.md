# Camera File Management
Highly configurable windows application to manage importing photos and videos from any type of camera.

For years I was frustrated with having dozens of copies of IMG_0001.jpg while managing photos coming off a fleet of Canon cameras and never having an efficient way to archive and sort them. I would often be looking for a specific photo, but had difficulty finding it because I had to search through my personal archives broken down by camera model and sift through unhelpful filenames. My fleet has since grown to include Nikon, GoPro, Google Pixel cell phones, and more so it was time for a change. I have developed Camera File Management ("CFM" or you could even pronounce is "seafoam") as a hobby project for myself, but I imagine many individuals are in similar situations.
